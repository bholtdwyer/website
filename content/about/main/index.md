  Hello! My name is Brendan Holt Dwyer (I go by "Holt"), and I am currently an economist in the Mass Torts practice at Bates White Economic Consulting in Washington, D.C. You've found my personal research website; any opinions expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of Bates White. I sudied economics (major) and computer science (minor) at Princeton University, worked as a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Board (Financial Stability), and received my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of California, San Diego in 2025. In my spare time I do occasional work on projects studying structural transformation and agriculture in developing countries (particularly India and Indonesia) and empirical U.S. macro, in particular the effects of federal procurement spending on local employment growth. If you're interested in any of those topics, feel free to drop me a line!
